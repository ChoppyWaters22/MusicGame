Short game. Won't last too long. 


Option 1: Many years ago, scientists ambitiously tried to harness gravity as an alternatuve energy source. Their experiments had cataclysmic results. A great flash of light overtook the world blinding everyone momentarily. When everyone came to, nearly all things on the planet had the gravity reversed. They were swallowed by the sky leaving those on the ground struck in fear. You live on the surface abiding by the rules, but deep inside you, you want to explore beyond the rules set before you. Highly organized. Everyone around you lives in fear of the sky as it swallowed many people whole according to legend. The surface world is much like our modern world except that flight is looked down upon and the sky is seen as a bad omen. You are the few who did not fall into the sky and swallowed by the great blue. Prime Minister Williams leads the your country, comprised of the few whose gravity was not reversed.

Option 2:For as long as you and everyone around you can remember, your people live underground. A reclusive society that dares not venture too far from the Safe Zones for fear of falling. Scavengers and diggers living in a series of tunnels that were made long ago. Beneath you is a bottomless abyss and those who have attempted to venture beyond it have never returned. Your good friend, Joshua, an ambitious dreamer filled with wanderlust always ventured beyond the Safe Zones and brought you "gifts" from his jounreys. These gifts are all quite plain. Toys, food, or other random objects. The only thing strange about them, is when you let them go, they rise up to ceiling. At some point, he said he was going on an expedition and never returned. You live in these tunnels according to the rules, but deep inside you, you want to explore beyond the Safe Zones.
